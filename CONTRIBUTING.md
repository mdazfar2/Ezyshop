### Guidelines for good commit message

1. **Be Concise and Descriptive**: Summarize the change in a way that’s easy to understand at a glance.
2. **Use the Imperative Mood**: Write as if giving a command (e.g., `Add`, `Fix`, `Update`), which is a convention in many projects.
3. **Include Context**: Provide context or reason for the change if it’s not immediately obvious from the summary.
4. **Reference Issues and Pull Requests**: Include `issue numbers` or PR references if the commit addresses them.
5. **Issue reference** (Optional): Include the issue number associated with the commit (e.g., `#123`).

## Reporting Issues

- Before submitting an issue, please search to ensure it has not already been reported.

- When creating a new issue, provide as much detail as possible, including:

1. The steps to reproduce the issue
2. What was expected to happen and what actually happened
3. Screenshots or logs, if applicable
4. Information about your environment (OS, browser, etc.)

### Feature Requests 

- Feel free to open an issue to request a new feature.
- Provide as much context and detail as possible. Why is the feature important? How do you envision it being used?
- Consider outlining how you think the feature could be implemented.

### Updating Documentation

- If you make changes to the code, please update relevant documentation (README.md etc.).
- Keep documentation clear, concise, and up-to-date.
